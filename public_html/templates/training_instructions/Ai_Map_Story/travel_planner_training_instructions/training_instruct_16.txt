I will provide with the conversation of user and assistance related to travelling.
You have to make json from that and have to add addtional inforamation related to places.
user json output should like this :
{
    "day1":{
        [
            { 
                "place": "full addresss of place or city here",
                "description": "description of place or city here( add description of 50 words by userself )"
            },
            .
            .
        ]
    },
    .
    .
    .
}
if you not found the travel scedule in the conversation then output simple false
